# 5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.

a = input("Enter the first string")
b = input("Enter the second string")
print("Before Swap :",a," ",b)
a1 = b[:2] + a[2:]
b1 = a[:2] + b[2:]
print("After Swap :",a1," ",b1)
